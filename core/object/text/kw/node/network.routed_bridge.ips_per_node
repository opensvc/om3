The number of ips each node must be able to allocate in the  network. This number is translated into the prefix length of the subnets distributed to each node.
For example if the network is a x.x.x.x/16 you can distribute
- x.x.x.x/17 subnets to 2 nodes
- x.x.x.x/18 to 4 nodes
- etc...

If both `mask_per_node` and `ips_per_node` are set, `ips_per_node` is ignored.
If only `ips_per_node` is set, it is honored for backward compatibility.

The `ips_per_node` keyword is deprecated because its value is hard to manage for large ipv6 subnets (e.g a x.x.x.x/48 subnet has 281474976710656 ips).
