A whitespace-separated list of `<var>=<sec name>/<key path>` or
`<sec name>/<key matcher>`.

If the `sec` or secret key doesn't exist then `start` and `stop` actions on
the resource will fail with a non 0 exit code.

A shell expression splitter is applied, so double quotes can be around
`<sec name>/<key path>` only or whole `<var>=<sec name>/<key path>`.

Example with,

* `<ns>/sec/cert1` a secret having a `server.pem` key with value `mycrt`.

* `<ns>/sec/sec1` a secret having a `key1` key with value `val1`.

`secrets_environment = CRT=cert1/server.pem sec1/*` creates the following
variables in the container command execution environment:

	CRT=mycrt
	key1=val1
