A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.",

A few can be created or deleted, but not renamed because the names are meaningful to Purity (e.g., VIFs, file systems, file system snapshots, volume snapshot).",
