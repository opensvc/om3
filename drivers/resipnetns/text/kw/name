The DNS name or IP address of the ip resource.

Scoping
-------

Can be different from one node to the other, in which case the
`name@<nodename>` scoping syntax can be used.

This is most useful to specify a different ip when the service starts in DRP
mode, where subnets are likely to be different than those of the production
datacenter.

DNS name caching
----------------

If the value is a DNS name, a lookup is done for every resource status
evaluation.

* If the lookup succeeds, the addr is store in a cache file.

* If the lookup fails, the address is fetched from the cache file.

  * If the cache is not expired (refreshed in the past 19 minutes) the
    address is trusted:

    * The resource status is degraded to from `up` to `warn`.

    * The resource restarts begin if `restarts > 0`.
      The restart is a no-op but the resource status is re-evaluated.
      If the lookup succeeds, the resource status to `up`.

    * The monitor action is triggered if all restarts failed and
      `monitor_action` is set.
      For example, a `freezestop` can still succeed using the cached
      ip address.

  * If the cache is expired (older than 19 minutes):

    * The resource status is `warn`, weither the actual untrusted ip
      address is plumbed or not.

    * The `stop` and `start` actions no longer work. An admin action
      is necessary to repair the configuration or dns lookups.
