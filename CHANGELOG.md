# OpenSVC Agent v3 Changelog

## Breaking Changes

### Cluster and Node Configuration

* **Time format change:**
    OpenSVC now uses RFC3339 time format for all internal and exposed data, replacing the Unix timestamps.

* **`cluster.name` default value:**
    In v2.1, the default cluster name was `default`.
    In v3, if `cluster.name` is undefined at startup, it will be automatically replaced with a randomly generated human-readable value.

* **`cluster.name` scope:**
    This keyword is no longer scopable.
    
* **`node.default_mon_format` removed:**
    It should be a user-level setting, not a node-level config.

* **`reboot` section removed:**
    * `reboot.schedule`
    
    * `reboot.pre`
    
    * `reboot.once`
    
    * `reboot.blocking_pre`

* **`rotate_root_pw` section removed:**
    * `rotate_root_pw.schedule`
    
* **`stats_collection` section removed:**
    * `stats_collection.schedule`
    
    * `stats.schedule`
    
    * `stats.disable`
    
### Object Configuration

* **Keywords removed:**
    * `svc_flex_cpu_low_threshold`
    
    * `svc_flex_cpu_high_threshold`

    * `constraints`
        Replaced by host label selectors in `nodes`.
        Example:
        ```
        [DEFAULT]
        nodes = az=fr1 az=us1
        ```
        
    * `always_on=<nodes>`
        Replaced by `standby=true`.
        This keyword was already marked deprecated in v2.1.

* **Driver Group Names Removed:**

    Drop support for driver group names:**

	* `drbd`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=drbd`
       
	* `vdisk`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=vdisk`
       
	* `vmdg`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=vmdg`
       
	* `pool`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=zpool`
       
	* `zpool`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=zpool`
       
	* `loop`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=loop`
       
	* `md`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=md`
       
	* `zvol`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=zvol`
       
	* `lv`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=lv`
       
	* `raw`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=raw`
       
	* `vxdg`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=vxdg`
       
	* `vxvol`
	   Replaced by `disk#foo.type=vxvol`

    For example, a `[md#1]` section needs reformatting as:
    ```
    [disk#1]
    type = md
    ```
      
    These driver group names were already deprecated in v2.1.

### Commands

* **Configuration updates use the daemon api by default:**
    `om set`, `om unset`, `om get`, `om eval` now need `--local` to operate on the local configurations without api calls.

* **Removed:**
    * `om node reboot`

    * `om node rotate root password`

    * `om node pushstats`

	* `node scan capabilities`
        Replaced by `node capabilities scan`
        
	* `node print capabilities`
        Replaced by `node capabilities list`
        
    * `om node abort`
        Replaced by `om cluster abort` to abort the pending cluster action orchestration.
        

 * **Flags Removed:**

    * `--debug`
        Replaced by `--log debug|info|warn|error|fatal|panic`.

    * `om get --eval`
        Replaced by `om eval`

    * `om foo set|unset --param ... --value`
        Replaced by `--kw`, which was also supported in v2.

    * `om delete --unprovision`
        Replaced by the `om unprovision` and `om delete` sequence or by `om purge`.

    * `om delete --rid`
        Replaced by `om unset --section <name>`.
        
    * `om <sel> <action> --dry-run`

* **Duration flags now require a unit:**
    ```
	--waitlock=60  ->  --waitlock=1m
	--time=10      ->  --time=10s
    ```
    
* **`print status`**:
    Change the instance-level errors and warnings (to no-whitespace words):
    ```
	part provisioned  ->  mix-provisioned
	not provisioned   ->  not-provisioned
	node frozen       ->  node-frozen
	daemon down       ->  daemon-down
    ```

* **`om create`:**
    * Simplify the flags
        ```
        --config           ->  --from
        --template         ->  --from
        ```

	* Support the following template selector syntaxes:
        ```
        --from 111
        --from template://111
        --from "template://my tmpl 111"
        ```

*  **`om node get|eval`:**
    In previous releases, `om node get --kw node.env` returned the keyword's raw string value from `cluster.conf` if it is not defined in `node.conf`:

    ```
	node.conf cluster.conf om node get om node eval om cluster get om cluster eval 
	--------- ------------ ----------- ------------ -------------- ---------------
	fr        kr           fr          fr           kr             kr              
	fr        -            fr          fr           -              -               
	-         kr           kr          kr           kr             kr              
	-         -            -           -            -              -               
    ```


    In this release, this command returns the empty string. The `eval` command is unchanged though (it still falls back to `cluster.conf`):

    ```
	node.conf cluster.conf om node get om node eval om cluster get om cluster eval 
	--------- ------------ ----------- ------------ -------------- ---------------
	fr        kr           fr          fr           kr             kr              
	fr        -            fr          fr           -              -               
	-         kr           -           kr           kr             kr              
	-         -            -           -            -              -               
    ```

* **`om foo run` and `om foo sync *`:**
    Propagate the task run and sync errors to a non-zero exitcode.
    
    The `task` and `sync` resources are now `optional=false` by default, but their status is not aggregated in the instance availability status whatever the `optional` value. Errors in the run produce a non-zero exitcode if optional=false, zero if optional=true.


* **`om <kvstore> change`:**
    This action is no longer failing if the key does not exist. The key is added instead.

* **`om node freeze`:**
    This command is now local only.
    Use `om cluster freeze` for the orchestrated freeze of all nodes.
    Same applies to `om node unfreeze` and its hidden alias `om node thaw`.

* **`om node logs`:**
    Now display only local logs.
    A new `om cluster logs` command displays all cluster nodes logs.

* **`om <sel> unset`:**
    Now accepts `--section <name>` to remove a cluster, node or object configuration section.

* **`om monitor`:**
    Instance availability icons changes:
    ```
	standby down: s => x
	standby up:   S => o
    ```
 
### Core

* **Object Names policy change:**
    Deny names and namespaces longer than 63 character.

* **Object selector policy:**
    Stop matching `DEFAULT.foo` with the `om foo: ls`.
    Match only objects with `foo` as a section basename (eg. `[foo#bar]`).

* **New cgroup layout:**
    The previous layout allowed conflicts between different object types (eg. `vol` and `svc`).

* **The `raw` jsonrpc protocol socket is dropped.**
    For example, this v2.1 API call is no longer supported:
    ```
    echo '{"action": "daemon_status"}' | socat - /var/lib/opensvc/lsnr/lsnr.sock
    ```
    
    To keep using a root Unix Socket in v3, you can switch to:
    ```
    curl -o- -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" --unix-socket /var/lib/opensvc/lsnr/http.sock http://localhost/daemon/status
    ```

   
### Driver: ip

* **Removed keywords:**
    * `dns_name_suffix`
    * `provisioner`
    * `dns_update`
   
* **Collector DNS zone:**
    This feature of the collector, used by the ip driver for one of its provisioning methods, is deprecated.

### Driver: fs

* **Removed keywords:**
    * `size`
        Configure a disk.lv resource
        
    * `vg`
        Configure a disk.lv resource
 
### Driver: sync

* **Removed actions:**
    * `om foo sync drp`
    Replaced by `om foo sync update --target drpnodes`.

    * `om foo sync nodes`
    Replaced by `om foo sync update --target nodes`.

    * `om foo sync all`
    Replaced by `om foo sync update`.

* **`sync full` and `sync update`:**
    Now both accept a `--target nodes|drpnodes|node_selector_expr` flag.

### Driver: app

* **`environment`**
    Now keeps the variable names unchanged and accepts mixedCase.
    ```
    With:
      environment = Foo=one bar=2 Z=u
      
    Foo=one     was previsouly changed to FOO=one
    bar=2       was previsouly changed to BAR=2
    Zoo=u       was previously changed to ZOO=u
    ```

* **Removed environment variables:**
    The following variables are no longer added to process environment during actions:
	* `OPENSVC_SVCNAME`
    
	* `OPENSVC_SVC_ID`

* **Changed environment variables:**
    * `OPENSVC_ID`
      In 2.1, `OPENSVC_ID` was set to the object name (for example `foo` in `test/svc/foo`).
      In v3 , `OPENSVC_ID` is set to the `DEFAULT.id` value.
  
* **Removed keywords:**
    * `kill`
        The default behaviour is now to kill all processes with the matching `OPENSVC_ID` and `OPENSVC_RID` variables in their environment.
    
        In 2.1 the default behaviour was to try to identify the topmost process matching the start command in the process command line, and having the matching env vars, but this guess is not accurate enough as processes can change their cmdline via PRCTL or via execv.
    
        If the new behaviour is not acceptable, users can provide their own stopper via the "stop" keyword.

### Object: sec

* **Removed actions:**
    * `om sec fullpem`
        The `fullpem` key is added to the sec on `gencert` action.

### Logging

* **No more private log files:**
    The agent logs to journald instead. So the log entries attributes are indexed and can be used to filter logs very fast. Use `journalctl _COMM=om3` to extract all OpenSVC logs. Add OBJ_PATH=foo/svc/svc1 to filter only logs relevant to an object.

* **Log entries key changes:**
    * The `sc` log entries attribute is replaced with `origin=daemon/scheduler`.

    * The `origin=daemon` log entries attribute is replaced with `origin=daemon/monitor`.

### Heartbeat: relay

The v3 agent needs to address a v3 relay.

The v3 relay must have a user with the `heartbeat` grant that the client will need to use.
```
om system/usr/relayuser create --kw grant=heartbeat
om system/usr/relayuser add --key password --value $PASSWORD
```

On the cluster nodes, store the relay password in a secret:
```
om system/sec/relay-v3 create
om system/sec/relay-v3 add --key password --value $PASSWORD
```

And the heartbeat configuration:
```
[hb#1]
type = relay
relay = relay-v2
secret = 3aaf0dae606212349b7123eb8cc7e89b
```

Becomes:
```
[hb#1]
type = relay
relay = relay1-v3
username = relayuser
password = system/sec/relay-v3
```

Where the password is the value of the `þassword` key in `system/sec/relay-v3`.

### Arbitrator

* The new keyword `uri` replaces `name`.

* When the uri scheme is http or https, the vote checker is based on a GET request, else it is based on a TCP connect.
  When the port is not specified in a TCP connect uri, the 1215 port is implied.

  Examples:

      uri = https://arbitrator.opensvc.com/check
      uri = arbitrator1.opensvc.com:1215
      uri = arbitrator1.opensvc.com               # implicitly port 1215

* The new keyword `insecure` disables the server certificate validation when the uri scheme is https, the default is false.

* The `name* keyword is deprecated. Aliased to `uri` to ease transition.

* The `timeout` keyword is removed to avoid users setting a value greater than the ready period,
  which would let the service double start before the end of the vote.
  The internal timeout value is now set to a third of the ready period.

* The `secret` keyword is now ignored.

## Enhancements

### Core
    
* The `set` and `unset` commands are complemented by `update --set ... --unset ... --delete`. This new command allow to have a single commit for different kind of changes. The set and unset commands are now hidden so users don't get tempted to use them anymore.
    
* New placement policy `last start`. Use the mtime of `<objvar>/last_start` as the candidate sort key. More recent has higher priority.

* Add --quiet to disable both the progress renderer and the console logging

* New fields in print schedule json format: node, path

### Daemon

* Add a 60 seconds timeout to `pre_monitor_action`. The 2.1 daemon waits forever for this callout to terminate.

* Earlier local object instance orchestration after node boot

    In 2.1 local object instance orchestration waits for all local object instances boot action done
    
    Now object instance <foo@localhost> orchestration only waits for <foo@localhost> boot action completed. Each instance has a last boot id.

## Upgrade from b2.1

### Cluster Config

* Need to set explicitely the `cluster.name` because the v3 daemon will generate a random cluster name if none is set:

    ```
    # Ensure cluster.name is defined before upgrade to v3
    om cluster set --kw cluster.name=$(om cluster eval --kw cluster.name)
    ```
